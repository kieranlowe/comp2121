DATA/REGISTERS:
floor_register
represented as bytes in data memory
0000000101 -> 8th floor and 10th floor

curr_floor
represented as just a number 0-10. indicates current floor

dir
represented as either 0 or 1 (and something else maybe?)

next_floor
use to record what floor we need to go to next

temp1, temp2
temporary register used for doing stuff

row, col, rmask, cmask
Used for scanning the keypad


PORTS
PortA & PortF
Used in initialising lcd

PortL
Used in setting up pull up resistors for the keypad

TCCROA/B

Main:
	Scan the keypad

	Button pushed, wait until button is no longer pressed
	
	Scan the floor_register and print the values

	
Keypad Scan:
	If 1-9, move Z pointer along n times and set that byte value to 1

	If symbol
		If 0, load Z pointer, store 1 into the first byte space
		If *, clear floor_register, set the first byte space with 1
	
	Return back to main
	
Timer:
	Every time the interrupt fires, we find the next floor we need to go to.
	
		If we have reached the value we need to go to, stop the timer, do other stuff
	
		If two seconds have passed, and the curr_floor is not the value we needed to go to, increment the curr_floor depending on the value of the next_floor register
		
	Increment the timers if we need to
	
	Return from interrupt, continue scanning the keypad
